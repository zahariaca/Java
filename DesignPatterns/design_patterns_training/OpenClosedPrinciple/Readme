Open/Closed Principle:
	Classes (or methods) should be open for extension and closed for modification.
	Once written they should only be touched to fix errors. New functionality should
	go into new classes that are derived. This is popularly interpreted to advocate
	inheriting from an abstract base class.
	Reasoning: Again you lower the odds of breaking existing code.
